xv6-vsd: The Veety Software Distribution

This is my unprofessional hackjob of xv6 to add features like users, multiple terminals, a better fs, etc. Its nowhere near the release 1 goal. Currently it only *really* supports qemu and still uses the baroque booting method of xv6. Most of the changes have been pretty minor, but they make a big difference in features.

Building:
gmake all

Running:
gmake qemu
