The real goal is to make VSD the development environment for VSD.


Immediate todos for rel 1:
	add devices /dev/console, /dev/null, /dev/zero (done)
	implement some kernel config mechanism (in progress)
		variable setting
		hostnames
	new bootloader (in progress, working)
	add device files for devices (in progress)
		uarts
		boot disk
	add auth to filesystem (in progress)
	get kernel auth working (in progress)
	add a few more utils (more, passwd, newuser, ed)
	environment vars
	improve shell (in progress)
	implement veetymux (in progress)
	implement shared memory threads (done)
	implement named pipes
	add some vfs capabilities

For future releases:
	installation mechanism
	networking
	more utilities (dd, df, etc)
	self-hosting
		remove gccisms from source
		port a simple and small c compiler and assembler
		port or implement ld, make (or mk), and ar (maybe the x86 port of v7?)
		remove dependencies on tools
	write new shell
	filesystem utilities (mkfs, etc)
	mounting (mount, unmount, bind syscalls and utils)
	more filesystem support (fat32 and iso9660 are a must)
