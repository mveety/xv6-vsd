Veety Software Distribution -- Old Bootloader README

This is the old xv6 bootloader. It fits in the mbr and loads an elf
executable out of the first few sectors. This works well for a simple
system, however it doesn't allow you to have the kernel in the
filesystem or give the kernel boot parameters. This isn't ideal. For
now, this is the only bootloader for VSD, but a new one will be in the
works soon. This bootloader will never go away and most likely is
enough for most people and should be considered the default.
