Veety Software Distribution -- New Bootloader README

This is was the old xv6 bootloader. Its new now. mbrasm.S+mbrmain.c
are the mbr part that read the filesystem superblock, parses the
bootelf inode, and loads bootelf. It then jumps to bootelf which gives
you the nice boot prompt and all that shit. bootelf give you the nice
boot: prompt and takes your input, loads the kernel off of the desired
device, and starts running it. bootelf has a simple command language.

bootelf commands:
	l[0-1] -- l loads a kernel off of device 0 or 1
	b -- boots the kernel with the desired settings.
	r[0-1] -- r sets the root device
